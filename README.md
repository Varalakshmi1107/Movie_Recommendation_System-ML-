## Introduction

The Movie Recommendation System leverages the power of NLP and machine learning to provide movie recommendations based on the content of movies. By analyzing various attributes of movies such as genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview, the system can find and recommend movies that are similar to the user's choice.

## Features

- Load and preprocess movie data from CSV files.
- Extract relevant features such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
- Use NLP techniques to transform text data into feature vectors.
- Compute the similarity between movies using cosine similarity.
- Generate and display movie recommendations based on similarity.

## Dataset

The project uses two datasets:

- **credits.csv**: Contains information about the cast and crew of movies.
- **movies.csv**: Contains information about the movies, including title, genres, keywords, and overview.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie_recommendation_system.git
   cd movie_recommendation_system
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure you have the datasets (`credits.csv` and `movies.csv`) in the project directory.

## Usage

1. Run the `movie_recommendation.py` script:
   ```bash
   python movie_recommendation.py
   ```

2. Use the `recommend` function to get movie recommendations. For example:
   ```python
   recommend('Avatar')
   recommend('Iron Man')
   ```
